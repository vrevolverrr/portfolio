            Hi there! My name is Soong Jun Shen. I am 19 this year and currently doing my A-Levels.
            I taught myself coding and designing since young due to a deep passion in technology.

            My dream is to improve how humans interact 
            with technology to so that we can utilize technology to its utmost potential.
            <br /><br />
